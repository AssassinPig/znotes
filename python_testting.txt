python testting
===============
```
import unittest

class TestAddition(unittest.cast):  #inherit
	
	def setUp(self):				#before testting
		print('set up the test')

	def tearDown(self):				#after testting
		print('tearDown')

	def test_towPlusTwo(self):		#run it
		total = 2+2
		self.assertEqual(4, total)  #assert

if __name__ == "__main__":
	unittest.main()

```

1. Provide setUp and tearDown functions that run before and after each unit test. (EACH unit test!!!)
2. Provide several types of “assert” statements to allow tests to pass or fail
3. Run all functions that begin with test_ as unit tests, and ignore functions that
are not prepended as tests


	def setUpClass():
	#this function will run only once at the start of the class
