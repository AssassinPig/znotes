1.setup 
https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py
sudo pip install redis

2.
import redis
r = redis.StrictRedis(host='', port=6739, db=0)
r.set('foo', 'bar')
r.get('foo')

two important class implement all most redis commands
StrictRedis
Redis(StrictRedis) #a subclass of StrictRedis

3.connection pools
pool = redis.ConnectPool(host=, port=, db=)
r = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)


4.Thread Safety
Redis client instances can safely be shared between threads. Internally, connection instances are only retrieved from the connection pool during command execution, and returned to the pool directly after. Command execution never modifies state on the client instance

It is no safe to pass PubSub or Pipeline object between threads.
