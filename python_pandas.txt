python pandas
==============
1. Series
    array with index
    index is from [0, N-1]
    obj.values()    #value
    obj.index()     #index
    if index doesn't match with value, value will be signed  as NaN
    And you can use isnull() and notnull() to validate whether value is null or notnull

2. DataFrame
    it is similiar with excel sheet.
